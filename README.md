# TTP WINTER 2022: FrontEnd Projects

Hi! This repository is a list of all the frontend static projects I worked on during the bootcamp for a program called Tech Talent Pipeline for Winter 2022. All of the projects I have done can be found online and the main purpose of this is to showcase different html/css/javascript applications that I have followed along with.

## Technologies

Here is a list of technical things I have learned about and a description of each:
- HTML: Used in order to make the layout of the page
- CSS: Used in order to design the page
- Javascript: Used to make the website interactive and provide functionality
- Netlify: Used to host some of the websites I found the most interesting
- Github: Used to hold all the subdirectories of individual projects
